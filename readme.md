Responsive Resizer Extension for Safari for MacOS
============

Resize the Safari browser window with precision when working on responsive website designs.

This Safari Extension lets you quickly and easily  change the viewport size of the Safari browser window. Ideal for testing mobile/handheld device sizes, or for live coding and arranging windows on small screens.

This extension is perfect for when you're doing responsive design. You can even use the Web Inspector like normal to inspect code.
